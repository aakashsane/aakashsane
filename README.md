Hello!
I am a postdoc at Princeton University / Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (NOAA). 

Broadly, my research is in fluid mechanics and physical oceanography. I am interested in understanding how small scale mixing in the upper ocean impacts weather and climate.

In my recent work, I have used neural networks to improve a vertical mixing scheme in the ocean component of a climate model and it has led to a better representation of physics along with a reduction of biases. My article shows how data-driven approaches can replace missing physics in Earth System Modeling. The article can be found [here](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023MS003890).

My doctoral studies focused on a regional model of the Narragansett Bay. I showed that a model of the Narragansett Bay and surrounding regions can be used for forecasting future conditions like temperature, currents, etc. Check out my paper [here](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020JC016875). This work forms a basis for establishing an oceanic forecasting system for the Bay region of Rhode Island.

Prior to being an oceanographer, I was working in interfacial fluid dynamics. I used theory and experiments to measure the surface tension of flowing soap films. We found a previously unknown dependence of the soap film’s terminal velocity on the film thickness and its flow rate. You can find my article [here](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2018.28) and a commentary paper on our work can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2018.301).
