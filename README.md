Hello!
I am a postdoc at Princeton University / Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (NOAA). My research is focused on improving turbulence parameterizations in the ocean component of climate models.

Currently, I am developing paramterizations of vertical mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer using physics and machine learning approaches.

My Ph.D. focused on a regional model of the Narragansett Bay. I applied concepts from information theory to find predictability time scales of the regional model using ensemble modelling approach and proposed a method to measure variability in ensemble models.
